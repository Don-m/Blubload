Blubload
========

Upload images using BLOB in the database

Note: This is a basic start for making an image uploading service using PDO. Images are directly saved in the database (BLOB). This is in no way ready to go for production.

To-do:
- More Object OriÃ«nted
- Adding more security: validating and encoding
