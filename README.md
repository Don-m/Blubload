Blubload
========

Upload images using BLOB

Note: This is a basic start for making an image uploading service using PDO. Images are directly saved in the database (BLOB). This is in no way ready to go for production.

To-do:
- More object oriÃ«nted
- Adding more security: validating and encoding
- Reading images with _GET should not be incremented by one. Bots will be able to iterate through every image by adding 1 to the current _GET
